Version: 1.0.0

Motivation: I've created this notebook to study a little more about the games
industry

In order to do it, I've download 2 datasets from Kaggle, one containing data
from steam with basically games owned by the users and their playtime.

The second one is a historical of games and their grades on the IGN website.

I will study both these datasets separatedly and try to cross some data
between them.
