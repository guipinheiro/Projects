Motivation: 

I've created this notebook to study a little more about the games industry

In order to do it, I've download 2 datasets from Kaggle, one containing data from steam with basically games owned by the users and their playtime.

The second one is a historical of games and their grades on the IGN website.

steam: https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games
ign: https://www.kaggle.com/egrinstein/20-years-of-games

I will study both these datasets separatedly and try to cross some data between them. :)

To compare changes, created a .Rmd file from the .ipynb. Check out this tutorial for it:
